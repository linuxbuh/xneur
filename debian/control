Description: in-place conversion of text typed in with a wrong keyboard layout
 When users work in multilingual environment (e.g. Russian+English), they
 sometimes type in text with wrong keyboard layout. In auto mode XNeur can
 automatically detect language of word user typed, switch keyboard layout and
 convert word from one keyboard layout into another. In manual mode user has
 ability to convert last typed word or some selected text with hot-keys.
 The main idea of this utility is similar to Punto Switcher for MS Windows.
 For now XNeur support English, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, French,
 Romanian, German, Kazakh and many other languages.
