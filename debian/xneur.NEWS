xneur (0.8.0+svn20080310-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From now we put dictionaries to /usr/share/xneur. Old dictionaries should be
  removed in preinst. If you changed something there, your modified version
  will be saved as <file>.dpkg-bak

  If you wish to override default dictionaries with your own, feel free to put
  them in /etc/xneur, they will have higher priority then ones in
  /usr/share/xneur.
